He mentions that the so-called defamiliarization is to take a thing out of its regular environment and depict it from a surprising and unfamiliar perspective, so as to bring a poetic feeling to the. <br></td>

    <td width="83%" valign="top">On the basis of defamiliarization, leading figures in Prague School extend the idea of foregrounding in depth. Bohuslav Havranek puts forward “automatization” and “foregrounding” in his work The Functional Differentiation of the Standard Language. Mukarovsky sheds light on the application of 13 foregrounding phenomenon in poetry. Besides, Jacobson’s contributions in foregrounding theory can be seen in his discussion on equivalence principle, projection and parallelism.

    <td width="83%" valign="top">British stylists Leech and Halliday make a systematic and all-around study on foregrounding featured by stylistic implications. Halliday maintains that whether certain linguistic feature can be regarded as foregrounding depends on the availability of motivation. Linguistic prominence solely is the benchmark of literary styles only when it relates the theme the whole work is trying to convey. In this way, Halliday distinguishes foregrounding theory from prominence. Leech’s classification of foregrounding, which is expounded in the next section, has made a great influence on text studies of literary wo

For the theoretical significance of foregrounding, domestic scholars have done in-depth research in recent years and gradually systematized it. The main ideas are: <br/><br/>
Foregrounding can enhance the expressive power and effect of language. The author uses the expression method of foregrounding to transcend the reader's reading habits and make foregrounding language behavior stand out in front of the reader, which enhances the expression effect and tension of the language.<br/><br/>
Foregrounding breaks through the conventional language and makes some common words or expressions new.<br /><br />
Foregrounding helps deepen the understanding of discourse, semantics and thematic meaning. By using foregrounding, the author interacts with the reader, arousing the reader's curiosity or novelty, and guiding the reader to pay attention to the understanding and evaluation of the discourse, semantics, and thematic meaning; while the reader reads the foregrounded language, the author's intention is reflected passively, inspiring the reader's thinking, and achieving appreciation and aesthetic needs.<br/><br/>
Compared with Western classroom teaching, there is less interaction between teachers and students, and students are not active in classroom thinking. The introduction of &quot;foregrounding&quot; in teaching can help the interaction between teaching and learning.<br/><br/>
Foregrounding is the driving force of literature development. The purpose of foregrounding is to deviate from the norm for thematic or artistic purposes, that is, to produce a &quot;different&quot; artistic or thematic effect. The hallmark of literature is foregrounding.<br/><br/>
