<div class="nytitle2" style="background-color:#0678c6" >
<strong>Deviation</strong><br>
Refers to the choice of linguistic elements out of the regular norm. Here are eight types of deviation. 
</div>
<div class="ul" style="background-color:#2060a2; overflow:hidden" >
<ul>
	<li>
		Grammatical Deviation: refers to the linguistic distortion of each single unit and internal structural form by means of misplacement or replacement.<br/>
	</li>
	<li>
		&nbsp;Semantic Deviation: occurs when a wordâ€™s meaning goes against the expectation formed by the surrounding words.<br/>
	</li>
	<li>
		Lexical Deviation: occurs when a new word is created or a common word has new meanings.&nbsp;<br/>
	</li>
	<li>
		Phonological Deviation: occurs in some phonological rhetoric, such as alliteration.&nbsp;<br/>
	</li>
	<li>
		Graphological Deviation: occurs in the case when the writing of words are against the norms of writing. Semantic deviation signifies illogical linguistic relations.&nbsp;<br/>
	</li>
	<li>
		Deviation of Register: occurs when one context of particular register borrows vocabularies of another.&nbsp;<br/>
	</li>
	<li>
		Dialectic Deviation:&nbsp; occurs when the author borrows language of another community to express his thoughts.&nbsp;<br/>
	</li>
	<li>
		Deviation of Historic Periods: implies the usage of language bearing different meaning for the on-going of times, such as 14 the usage of Latinate language.
	</li>
</ul>

<div class="nytitle2" style="background-color:#007ea7">
<strong>Parallelism</strong><br>
The repetition of words or sentences that sharing similar ideas and grammatical patterns. Here are two types of parallelism.</div>
<div class="ul" style="background-color:#005a7a; overflow:hidden">
	<ul>
		<li>
			Parallel structure:  refers to the structure formed by laying together two or more words, phrases, clauses or sentences that share identical or similar grammatical organization.&nbsp;<br/><br/>
		</li>
		<li>
			Repetition: means words or sentences repeatedly used in literary works to convey an emphatic effect. It is another kind of quantitative foregrounding widely used in the source text.<br/><br/>
		</li>
	</ul>

<p><strong><em>A Linguistic Guide to English Poetry</em></strong></p>
<p>In this book, British linguist Leech  develops a relatively complete theory on foregrounding after giving the definitions of paradigmatic relation and syntagmatic relation, also coined as deviation and parallel structure respectively. </p>
